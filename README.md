# tamagoh - Understanding egg/egglog by implementing it

This is my personal project to understand egg (e-graphs good) and egglog by implementing it in Haskell.
For serious usage, go to [hegg][hegg].

## Etymology

"Tamago (卵 or 玉子 in Kanji; たまご in Hiragana)" means "egg" in Japanese.
The suffix "-h" is purely borrowed from *H*askell.
